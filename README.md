# clustering_text_classification
Using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to process and classify raw text data.

- Objective:
    Pick a set of texts, process the texts and apply a series of unsupervised clustering methods to group the 
    texts. 
    Now analyze which clustering method groups the texts most consistely with respect to the person of 
    interest. 
    Apply supervised and unsupervised permutations of feature selection and generation to build a model 
    that will classify the texts by person of interest. 
    Lastly, evaluate this model against a holdout group of 25%, analyze the consistency of its prediction and 
    explain any notable divergencies.
